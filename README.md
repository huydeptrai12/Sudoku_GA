# HOW TO USE THIS
The Genetic algorithm are implemented in sudouk_GA.py, to test run test.py.
You can specify the difficulty (eg: 0.3) of the initial sudoku by typing in the terminal:
python test.py 0.3

If the difficulty is higher than 0.5, the algorithm tends to fail to find the solution.
For difficulty from (0, 0.5] it takes significantly less time to execute.# Sudoku_GA
